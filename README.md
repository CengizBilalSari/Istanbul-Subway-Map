# Istanbul-Subway-Path-Visualizer
This project involves writing a Java program that finds and visualizes the path between two input metro stations on the Istanbul metro map using the StdDraw library.
The goal of this project is to find the path between two specified metro stations and visualize the journey on a map. The input consists of station names, their coordinates, and the metro lines they belong to.
Each station can be part of multiple lines if it's a transfer point (breakpoint).
## Key Features
  Station Validation: Ensure that input station names are valid.
  Path Finding: Determine the unique path between two stations.
  Console Output: Print the path to the console.
  Visualization: Animate the path using the StdDraw library.
